### PutsPutsDoomDoom
(=> webSocket based game <=)

This is a demo sample of 2D pve/pvp browser game.
We have vision to make gameArena where players need to work together to survial pve events and 
after that they must face against themselfs.

There can be only one !
( World of warcraft pve is inspiration fot that, dungeons raids and etc )
Next upgrade will be to have android joystic, and then multiple players can play on 1 screen and try to protect Well of the cabbage.

Think it's a good idea to join people, because everyone has an Android phone, and everybody loves games ...
Games are much more interesting when you play it in companion ... lets build it XD

To run this demoSimulation you have to :

0. Open the file ``` static/config.js ``` and set ip adres to your own (local).
1. Type in console ``` node server.js ```  and you can play online with your friends in network !
2. Visit from browser: localhost:3690 , Good Luck  XD
